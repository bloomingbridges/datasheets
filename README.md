# Data Stranding

A minimal, single purpose, single page web app for creating _beautiful_ data sheets

No tracking, no login, just _FOSS_

Created as a finger exercise to impress a potential client. As such, I consider it feature complete. __Pull requests welcome.__

## Tips & Tricks

* You should be able to just save the page to your computer to use it locally. All data is stored on your browser via _localStorage_.

* When exporting, make sure to select "Print backgrounds" in the print dialog for dividers to show up.
